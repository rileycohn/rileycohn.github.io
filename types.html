            <h2>What are the different types of programming languages?</h2>
            <p>On this page, I will introduce you to the 3 main <i>types</i> of programming languages. Notice how I did not say the 3 main programming langauges?
            Programming languages can be broken down into 3 broad categories: 
            <ul>
                <li>Machine Code</li>
                <li>Assembly Language</li>
                <li>High-Level Languages</li>
            </ul>
            Although most programmers deal with languages in the high-level category most frequently, there are still people who develop using the others as well. Now let's have a 
            look at what these types of programming langauges are, and when to use them.</p>
            <br>
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <th>Language Type</th>
                    <th>Description/Uses</th>
                    <th>Sample Code</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Machine Language</td>
                    <td>Machine code is written in hexidecimal and the instructions are interpreted directly in the hardware. All of the instructions 
                    are written using very low-level instructions, such as: add, sub, and div. Most programmers will never have to write machine code outside of 
                    maybe a classroom setting.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src = "machine.JPG"
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        Assembly Language
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        Assembly languages are simply machine code encoded into a much more human readable form. Programmers who work close to hardware, 
                        such as programming microcontrollers, may find assembly language useful for interfacing with the devices they use.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <img src = "assembly.JPG" width = "500" height="500">
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>High-Level Languages</td>
                    <td>
                        High-level languages are the types of languages you are probably used to seeing, and are the most common type of language that developers use.
                        these days. High level languages have names for almost everything, have the ability to perform extremely complex expressions, and most importantly
                        the programmer doesn't have to interface directly with the registers of the computer in order to perform operations. <br>
                        <br>
                        Examples of high-level languages:
                        <ul>
                            <li>C/C++</li>
                            <li>Java</li>
                            <li>C#</li>
                            <li>JavaScript</li>
                            <li>Python</li>
                            <li>Swift</li>
                            <li>And so many others!</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                    <td>Here's a sample "Hello World" program in the high level langauge of Java <br>

                    </td>
                </tr>
