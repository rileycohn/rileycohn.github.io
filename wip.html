                    <h3>What do people mean by a "program"?</h3>
                    <p>If you have no experience in the world of programming
                    you may have this idea in mind from movies and TV shows that
                    programmers sit at a computer and mash the 0 and 1 buttons
                    all day. As fun as that may sound and look, this is not how modern
                    day programs are written.<br>

                    You actually use software that programmers created nearly every moment of
                    every day. In fact, your ability to even view this webpage is due to the 
                    works of millions of hours of work from experienced programmers including: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Computer Programmers - who developed the software necessary to make all that metal do something useful</li>
                        <li>Internet Engineers - who make access to the world wide web even possible</li>
                        <li>Web Browser Programmers - who designed and programmed whatever browser you happen to be using</li>
                        <li>And so many more specializations and fields!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h3>"But I still have no idea what a program is!"</h3>
                    Here is a great definition of a program found on the internet: <i>"An organized list of instructions that, when executed, causes 
                    the computer to behave in a predetermined manner. Without programs, 
                    computers are useless. A program is like a recipe. It contains a list of 
                    ingredients (called variables) and a list of directions (called statements) 
                    that tell the computer what to do with the variables. The variables can represent 
                    numeric data, text, or graphical images. There are many programming languages -- 
                    C, C++, Pascal, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, and LISP are just a few. These are all high-level languages. 
                    One can also write programs in low-level languages called assembly languages, although this is more 
                    difficult. Low-level languages are closer to the languageused by a computer, while high-level languages 
                    are closer to human languages."</i> -<a href = "http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/program.html">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/program.html</a>

                    In the next section we will learn about the different types of programming and how they are related and 
                    how they differ!
