                        <h3>Not Only Bad Guys</h3>
                        <p>A lot of people have this notion in their head that
                       all programmers/coders are these evil people
                       who just try and hack everyone. This is simply not true.
                       Programmers come from many different backgrounds and 
                       develop many different technologies. In fact, most do not even
                       have the know-how to hack you if they wanted to.</p>

                    <h3>What are we going to learn?</h3>
                    <p>This website will teach the basic knowledge necessary
                    in order to begin diving into the world of programming. We will start 
                    with discussing what programming actually is.
                    We will advance then onto the different types of programming and talk about the different 
                    development environments many programmers use.</p>

                    <h3>Hello World!</h3>
                    <p>This is an example of a "Hello world" program. A hello world program is 
                    typically the first program you will write when you begin using a new language.
                    This is because it introduces you to the basics of the language with minimal effort.
                    This image is the "Hello World" program written in the programming language C.</p>
