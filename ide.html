            <h2>What is an IDE?</h2>
            <p>An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a software program that programmers use to develop their code. Most IDEs have built in 
            code editors, compilers, and debuggers to help aid the developer complete his/her project. IDEs are used as a replacement for the typical code editor/command line 
            means of development. Many experienced developers tend to lean towards the old fashioned way of development, but I personally believe that IDEs are an extremely
             useful tool that all programmers should utilize when appropriate.
             <br><br>
             Let's have a look at the most popular IDEs used by today's professionals and amatuer developers. </p>

             This chart from CodeAnywhere is the result of a survey of their userbase where they asked for the users' code editor/IDE preferences. The top 2 results 
             of the survey are code editors and not IDEs, so the most popular IDE from their userbase is Eclipse. Eclipse is so popular because of its versatility. Eclipse supports 
             a multitude of languages and even used to be the preferred method of Android App development prior to the release of Android Studio. In fact, many experienced Android devs still 
             prefer using Eclipse for the IDE despite the standard changing towards Android Studio.

             Visual Studio also made the list of most popular IDEs due to its high power and usability in Windows application development.

             A very important piece of information about these 2 IDEs is that they are offered free of cost. This is very important for students and amatuer 
             developers who don't have the money to pay for any expensive development equipment. There are options for more robust versions of these IDEs with a price tag, but for most 
             programmers, the free version is more than enough.</p>
